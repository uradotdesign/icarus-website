## Introduction

>As described by it's own developer

{{< alert >}}
EOTK provides **a tool for deploying HTTP and HTTPS onion sites** to provide official onion-networking presences for popular websites.

The result is essentially a "man in the middle" proxy; you should set them up only for your own sites, or for sites which do not require login credentials of any kind.

**A thorough [implementation guide](https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk/blob/master/docs.d/HOW-TO-INSTALL.md)** is available on the project's **[repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk)**, therefore, we will be providing translations in other **[available languages](/docs)** for our guides.
